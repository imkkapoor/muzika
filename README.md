3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with your Spotify API and Firebase configuration. To get your Spotify credentials, you'll need to set up a Spotify Developer Account and create an application to obtain your credentials:

    ```
    CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
    CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
    REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri

    - Set up Firebase Firestore with two base collections:
        - **`users`**: To store user profiles and related data.
        - **`songs`**: To store song information and comments. Each song should have a `comments` sub-collection, with comments potentially having a `reply` sub-collection.
